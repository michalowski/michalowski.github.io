[Zingy](http://beatbots.net/zingy) is a robotic character based on the [Keepon Pro](http://beatbots.net/keepon-pro) armature. I designed Zingy as mascot for UK-based [EDF Energy](http://edfenergy.com)'s *Feel Better Energy* campaign with advertising agency [AMV BBDO](http://amvbbdo.com). Zingy was featured in a series of video and print advertisements highlighting EDFâ€™s low-carbon electricity generation and price promise.
