    excerpt: "[My Keepon](http://beatbots.net/my-keepon), developed in partnership with UK-based [Wow! Stuff](http://wowstuff.com), was a toy version of [Keepon Pro](http://beatots.net/keepon-pro). In its touch mode, it responds to pokes, pats, and tickles with a rich variety of emotional movements and sounds. In its dance mode, it hears the beat in music or clapping and dances in synchronized rhythm.  My Keepon is also hackable by connecting an Arduino: code is at [Github](http://github.com/BeatBots/MyKeepon), and surgical instructions are at [MAKE Magazine](http://makezine.com/projects/my-franken-keepon)."

The [Keepon](http://beatbots.net/keepon-pro) robot was designed by [Dr. Hideki Kozima](http://www.ei.tohoku.ac.jp/xkozima/index-eng.html) for child development research and autism therapy. I completed my PhD research at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://ri.cmu.edu) with a thesis on [rhythmic human-robot social interaction](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4891551287a3aa725779cef8f8f9be15) that primarily used Keepon as a research platform. After creating a few viral videos of Keepon dancing, we started [BeatBots](http://beatbots.net) to commercialize Keepon and to expand our robotic character design practice.
