In Spring 2025, I enrolled in [CCSF](https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/ccsf-catalog/courses-by-department/architecture)'s *Architecture Design Studio I* (ARCH 101) with [Prof. Amily Huang](https://www.ccsf.edu/directory/amily-huang). I completed a series of 2D and 3D design projects relating to visual perception of form, architectural meaning, and spatial experience.

## Mapping

For a project oriented around mapping and tracing, I explored ways of visualizing a bicycle ride's quality as a function of three distinct factors: *safety*, *effort*, and *beauty/utility*.

## Mondrian

We were tasked with designing a 20'-cube-sized structure and building a 1:24-scale model inspired by Piet Mondrian's [*Broadway Boogie Woogie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Boogie_Woogie). I created a tiny residence whose framing derives from the painting's linework, with the ability to modularly pull horizontal supports (for floors, railings, shelves, and work surfaces) from the dots.

## Sukkah

We were assigned a project to develop a structure inspired by the symbolism and constraints of a [sukkah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkah). My design (and 1:12-scale model) was one of four winners of a class-internal competition (in the spirit of [Sukkah City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkah_City) or [Sukkahville](https://www.kehilla.ca/sukkahville)). It is a dome constructed from tent poles that converge on an oculus that directs occupants toward Polaris, the north star, and uses bands of natural fabric to precisely shade the heads of dining occupants from the arc of the sun at the sukkah's location during the week of the Sukkot harvest festival.
