I joined Google in 2014 during its acquisitions of [Bot & Dolly](http://linkedin.com/company/bot-&-dolly) and Autofuss (with whom I'd been working for a few years) along with other robotics companies. Some of those efforts were later brought into [Google's X division, otherwise known as Alphabet's "Moonshot Factory."](http://x.company) I was the operations lead on a small team that grew and developed our technology inside X for five and a half years, culminating in our graduation to an independent Alphabet company called [Intrinsic](http://intrinsic.ai) in July 2021.

Intrinsic is an AI and robotics company working to unlock the creative and economic potential of intelligent robotics. Today, Intrinsic is building a platform that makes industrial robots radically easier to program, teach, and operate, so more people can use robotics to create new products, businesses, and services.

After graduating, Intrinsic launched [Flowstate](http://intrinsic.ai/flowstate), a web-based tool for developers to build their own robotic applications. I have been a Technical Program Manager and am currently a Product Manager on Flowstate, responsible for the framework by which *assets* (software modules, digital twins, etc) can be created or onboarded to the platform and reused across solutions. [I have also led a collaboration with ETH Zurich and Gramazio Kohler Research.](/portfolio/semiramis)
