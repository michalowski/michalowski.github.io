I started Dirty Robot Brew Works in Pittsburgh with [Philipp Michel](http://linkedin.com/in/phlip) and continued it in San Francisco with [Matthew Bitterman](http://linkedin.com/in/matthew-bitterman-b66b05169). 

We designed and built a mobile 20-gallon brew rig that can be set up anywhere with a hose connection and a propane or natural gas hookup. The kettles are suspended from aircraft cable that can be winched to raise or lower them for gravity-assisted liquid transfer.

We used industrial robots in the [Bot & Dolly](http://linkedin.com/company/bot-&-dolly) studios to perform repetitive or arduous tasks like stirring, winching, or mashing in.
