    excerpt: "[Semiramis](http://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/d/projekte/409.html) is an architectural installation designed with artificial intelligence and constructed in 2022 at the entrance of a new Tech Cluster Zug, Switzerland. As a herald for the increasingly interwoven collaboration between machines and humans, it aims to go beyond usual urban programs and rises as a vertical urban habitat reserved for plants and small local animals. The structure is 22.5 meters in height without vegetation and is composed of five amorphous wooden pods sustained by 8 thin steel pillars."

[Intrinsic](http://intrinsic.ai) contributed motion-planning software to the challenging problem of coordinating the simultaneous motions of four gantry-mounted industrial robot arms in [ETH Zurich's Robotic Fabrication Laboratory (RFL)](http://ita.arch.ethz.ch/archteclab/rfl.html). I served as the account and program manager for Intrinsic's participation in this collaboration with [ETH and Gramazio Kohler Research](http://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/d/projekte/409.html).
