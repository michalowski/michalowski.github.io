In 2015, together with a small team of roboticists and designers at Google, I participated in building an experimental sculptural installation to explore possibilities for robot mobility in custom fabrication. An industrial robot arm on a wheeled base precisely drilled thousands of holes in a foam structure to cast shadows indicating the time of day from the position of the sun in the sky.  The resulting digital sundial was temporarily installed in Mountain View's Charleston Park.
