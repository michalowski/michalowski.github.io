[BeatBots](http://beatbots.net) is a robotic character design practice I co-founded with [Dr. Hideki Kozima](http://www.ei.tohoku.ac.jp/xkozima/index-eng.html), designer of the [Keepon Pro](http://beatbots.net/keepon-pro) research robot. Keepon was created for child development research and autism therapy. We sold a number of the robots to university labs and research institutions.
